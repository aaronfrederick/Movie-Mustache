Movie Mustache

The Situation:
Watching a movie with friends, the twist being that there are is a non-zero number of mustaches on the TV screen and every time a mustache lines up with a character, you drink.

The Process:
1) Acquire Movie Data (for this example: Harry Potter 1)
2) Find software (a package) that draws bounding boxes on faces
3) Make a 3D histogram of bounding-box-centroids using x,y bins and counts for each x,y coordinate pair
4) Make a GIF of the movie with mustaches right below the top coordinate pairs
